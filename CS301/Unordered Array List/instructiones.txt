Modify the supplied class ArrayListClass the following ways:


a)      the method removeAt, which is inherited from the class ArrayListClass, of the class UnorderedArrayList removes an element from the list by shifting the elements of the list.  However, if the element to be removed is at the beginning of the list and the list is fairly large, it could take a lot of computer time to perform the operation.  Because the list elements are in no particular order, you could simply remove the element by copying the last element in the list at the position of the item to be removed and reducing the length of the list.  Redefine the method removeAt, in the class UnorderedArrayList, using this technique.


b)      the method remove of the class ArrayListClass removes only the first occurrence of an element.  Add the method removeAll to the class ArrayListClass as an abstract method that would remove all occurrences of a given element.  (Note that you must add the method removeAll in the interface ArrayListADT.)  Also, write the definition of the method in the class UnorderedArrayList. 


c)      add the methods min and max to the class ArrayListClass, as abstract methods, to return the smallest and largest respective elements in the list.  Also, write the definitions of the methods in the class UnorderedArrayList.


d)      Write a program which thoroughly tests these modifications and demonstrates correctness.
